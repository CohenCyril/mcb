Try to implement a 'packed-classes' plugin in order to
systematize/automate/hide the verbosity of declaring new instance (and
hence adding a new structure) in a hierarchy of packed classes.

Technicalities

It seems that the best available solution as of today is LaTeX, we
mentionned:
- TeXmacs but it is not sure it scales to a book
- coqdoc but the pdf rendering is ugly plus we will have lots of math
symbols

Other question: do we plan to have an other format that pdf? Yves
mentionned ebooks. Probably no.

-> decision: good old latex.

Cyril mentions tryocaml for complement, teaching oriented,
material. Everyone agrees that it is good/mandatory to have a sort of
"course", lecture material.

Yves about the process in the CoqArt sources:

- a perl script 

- it recognizes the portions of text between special
  delimiters and put them in a separate file. There is a key for each portion,
with a number. Then the output of the Coq execution is stored in a
  third file. There is a single Coq file per chapter. The keys are
  used to separate the output which is parsed back and included in the
  LaTeX sources.

- Caveat : inlined code was not executed by the device.
