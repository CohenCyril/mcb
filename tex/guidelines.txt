English/LaTex:

- Use an american dictionnary for spell checking
- Capitalize Section, Chapter, Lemma
- use macros for Coq, ssreflect, mathcomp, as in myacronyms
- Finish sentences with a period followed by a line break or *two* spaces.
  This convention is respected by Emacs and can be used in keyboard bindings
  such as "Esc-k" for "kill to the rest of the sentence."
