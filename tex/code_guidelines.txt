Coq code:

- Do not use the |* *| delimiters in the code
- Use Check only for checking well-formednes, and About for queries
- Use consistent names for bound variables :
  + n, m, k, l for nat
  + b for bool
  + s for seq
  Enforce type annotations otherwise.
- Put a type annotation for the sort of inductives.
