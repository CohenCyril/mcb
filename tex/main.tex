\part{The art of formalizing}

\chapter*{Computational Thinking}\label{ch:compthink}

This chapter should motive the activity of formalizing mathematics
with the {\bf Coq} proof assistant, emphasizing its computing skills,
and as opposed to other foundations like HOL. However the challenge is
to keep mathematicians as the privileged target, while motivating the
ssr approach to a CS oriented reader.

See \verb+../coq/ch0.v+.

Aim of the chapter:
\begin{itemize}
\item should sound natural and easy to a CS person (but with the ssr twist)
\item should sound different but well motivated to a Coq user (do show, maybe in
  the exercises, that leqn is 100 times better than "Inductive le").  Try to
  reproduce the shock we had the first time we used Boolean predicates.  It may
  help to compare, in the *advanced* section, the approach with the standard
  one, so that one sees two proof scripts in the same page.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Logics}

From calculability to proofs, hence the CC, and the fact that
reasoning principles without a computational content become axioms.

This is a non technical chapter and message should be:
\begin{itemize}
\item instantiation of a universal statement is application
\item Excluded middle is not available by default (choice?)
\item Conversion as a pervasive indistinguishably, what inside
  (beta, definition unfolding,...)
\item Dependent types: eq, sigma (which example?)
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Programming}

Presentation of inductive data structures, recursive programs on these
data.
Bool, Boolean connectives, Boolean reflection (cf
ch. \ref{ch:compthink}), views.
Examples of equality tests ($==$, with a forward reference to
explain the magic if needed), operations on sequences, nats,
exercises on prime, div.

\chapter{Proofs}

Where one learns to do proofs.
Boolean reflection in practice, views, discussion on the definition of leq,
proofs on things defined in the
previous chapter, associated tactics, exercises on prime, div,
binomial, etc.

\chapter{Mixing data and proofs}
Boolean sigma types, records, coercions, UIP. Examples: ordinals,
tuples (not their use which requires CS). This chapter might come
after some presentation of basic canonical structures, i.e. reorganize
the content between this chapter and the next.

\chapter{Type inference/Genericity}

Implicit arguments (Is it possible to survive without implicit
argument up to this point? We should probably use them plus forward
references to here), canonical structures. Combining with
notations. Now the real $==$, tuples. 

\chapter{Hierarchy}
Packaging records, the bigop hierarchy.
Scaling with packed classes and mixins, to the ssralg
hierarchy. Presentation of the content of ssralg in terms of structures
and of the theory? Should the latter be a separate chapter.

\chapter{Larger scale reflection}
Four colours, decomposition in primes, example in peterfalvi. In
particular example where a case analysis does not follow the
constructors of an existing inductive type: then craft an ad hoc one
to hint the proof. This topic is probably at a wrong place.

\part{Mathematics in Mathematical Components}

\chapter{Numbers}

Axiomatization, order is defined from norm, partial orders (in
particular for complex numbers).

\chapter{Polynomials, Linear algebra}

2-stage presentation: interface plus explicit. Expansion of
Georges'ITP paper. Here is one of the main application of the choice
operator (complement a base).

\chapter{Quotients}

\chapter{Finite group theory}

Data-structures, how to craft the set of variants of a same theorem to
make the formalization handy. Permutations. Presentations?

\chapter{Representation theory, Character theory}

As an example of application, in particular of the linear algebra
theory.

suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get more information when you do not understand the error
  message
\item Search in the library
\item Canonical structures: define a new instance
\item Canonical structures: add a new structure
\item Give a relevant name to the lemma I just stated
\item Forbid unwanted expansions
\item Choose a notation (what not to do...)
\item Compute ``for real'' (Natbin, Coqeal)
