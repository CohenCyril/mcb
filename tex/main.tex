\mantra{
	if you have a proof in mind, don't let the system drive you
        to another, less clean and abstract, proof.
}

Declaring an instance is hard... we need to document the multuiple processes
for each structure in each hierarchy and possibily make a program out of it.

% \chapter{Larger scale reflection (out of place)}
% Four colours, decomposition in primes, example in peterfalvi. In
% particular example where a case analysis does not follow the
% constructors of an existing inductive type: then craft an ad hoc one
% to hint the proof. This topic is probably at a wrong place.

\section{STYLE of these chapters}
These chapters hopefully in the following style:
\begin{itemize}
\item first math mode to review the (not so standard) definitions and
\item then touch some real proof script to show why/how the definition
  make it possible to model the proofs (as they are in math)
\item use the (few) examples to illustrate a cool proof strategy if
  any (not necessarily typical of the math subject, but that happens to
  be there, like in OOTHM paper: circular leq, symmetries, ad hoc
  decision procedure, ...)
\item try hard to show how CIC helps (which feature: HO, computation, dependent
	types \ldots), so that at the end we can sum up and make a synthesis of
	all that.
\end{itemize}

Maybe it is simpler to do it in 2 steps:
1) in this second part one identifies where CIC or the SSR style plays a
   crucial role
2) then we advertise these use cases in the first part to motivate
   the techniques, the complexity of the logic...

\chapter{Numbers}

What are the numbers available in the library? How to use them, casts
between types... Non trivial point in the formalisation:
axiomatization, order is defined from norm, partial orders (in
particular for complex numbers).


\chapter{Polynomials, Linear algebra}

2-stage presentation: interface plus explicit. Expansion of
Georges'ITP paper. Here is one of the main application of the choice
operator (complement a base).

\chapter{Quotients}

\chapter{Finite group theory}

Data-structures, how to craft the set of variants of a same theorem to
make the formalization handy. Permutations. Presentations?

\chapter{Representation theory, Character theory}

As an example of application, in particular of the linear algebra
theory.

\chapter{Galois Theory}

\chapter{Algebraic closure}

\part{Conclusion and perspectives}

Let's be brave:
This part looks back to the techniques, methodologies and achieved
formalized libraries described in the book and summarizes the role
played by each on them, in the spirit of the introduction to the ssr manual.
May be also discusses the possible extensions
(like CoqEAL) or adaptation to the future evolutions of the system and
formalism (Cubical Coq, HITs...).

suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get more information when you do not understand the error
  message
\item Search in the library
\item Canonical structures: define a new instance
\item Canonical structures: add a new structure
\item Give a relevant name to the lemma I just stated
\item Forbid unwanted expansions
\item Choose a notation (what not to do...)
\item Compute ``for real'' (Natbin, Coqeal)
\item MathComp script style
\end{itemize}
