roundtrip
=========

Principles:
- you can compile the tex without Coq, so all the expected output is there,
  in the tex
- you can reuse snippets behind the scenes (like Require Import ....)

Commands:
- you can *define* a *snippet* in your tex (ignored by tex)
- you can *define* a Coq *run* on a combination of snippets (ignored by tex)
- you can *print* a cleaned up version of a *snippet* (printed by tex) asserting
  it is equal to a more "instrumented" snippet
- you can *print* a cleaned up version of the *output* of Coq (printed by tex)
  asserting it is equal the real one
